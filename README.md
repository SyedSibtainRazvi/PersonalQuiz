# Personal Quiz

## Description:
This is an amazing **CLI Personal Quiz** application that I have build. It has a series of **question** and you are awarded 1 point for every right answer and **final score** displayed at the end of the game.

### Technologies Used:
1) JavaScript (Node JS).
2) Replit.
3) *readLineSync* [npm readlineSync](https://www.npmjs.com/package/readline-sync)

**Brief:** In this project, I have used an **readlineSync module** to read the input from the user, and then an **object** of questions and answers. To check the answers, I have put **If/Else conditions** and finally **for loop** to keep moving to next questions. For score, I have set a global variable that gets incremented.

#### What Next?
Implement **Chalk module** to implement beautiful styling  to the application and make it more interactive.

#### How to contribute?

_I love building things, it does not matter whether the application is small or huge. So if you are new to this technology and eager to learn, we can go ahead and develop more features in the application._
